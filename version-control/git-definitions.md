# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    -  Version control is a system that allows programmers to look at each instance a file is changed. It also lets you roll back your code to an earlier version if something breaks and you need to fix it.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a tangential part of code that you can work on independently of other people or branches. It lets you work on pieces of code that fit into the master code without changing what is already known to work. Once the changes are final and ready, you can merge it back into the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is a save point in a git repository. Good commit messages are specific, succint, and readable.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is when git prevents you from merging a branch into another because of competing changes.
