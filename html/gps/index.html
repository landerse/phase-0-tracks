<!--
  What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  Semantic tags exist because they give meaning to the elements rather than just organizing them. They also provide accessibility for other developers and even yourself if you come back to edit it later. 
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  It reads top to bottom.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I learned how to create snippets, and it seems like a very powerful tool that should be used whenever possible.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  This challenge was very straight-forward and neither my nor I hit any major roadblocks.
