	<h1> Cats in Fezzes! </h1>
	<h2> Things they are:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cute</strong></li>
		<li>Perfect</li>
	</ul>
	<h2> Things they are not:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Definitely</em> not thinking about murdering their owner for putting a fez on them.</li>
		<li>Dogs</li>
	</ol>
	<p> If you still remain unconvinced of their cuteness and bloodlust, may I direct you to <a href="https://kitchenmischief.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cat.jpg"> this picture </a>
